  <h2>Why Designing?</h2>
  <p class="intro">
    It all kicked off in my second year of college, the moment I got my very first laptop. 
    I still remember scrolling through YouTube when I randomly heard someone say, 
    "You can inspect websites and mess around with them." That instantly sparked my curiosity.
  </p>

  <p>
    So I opened up the Google homepage, right-clicked, and hit Inspect. A whole new world opened up. 
    I started tweaking colors, shifting margins, stretching buttons, changing text. 
    Suddenly, I wasn’t just browsing a site — I was breaking it apart and building it back, one style at a time. 
    And it was fun. Like, really fun. That’s when it hit me. This is my thing. This is where I belong.
  </p>

  <p>
    And maybe the universe caught the vibe, because not long after, a friend called me about an internship 
    that combined design and development. I jumped in, started designing real screens, building stuff from scratch, 
    and soaking up everything like a sponge.
  </p>

  <p>
    From that first inspect on Google to crafting full-fledged interfaces, it’s been a wild and exciting ride. 
    No complaints. Just the pure joy of creating, exploring, and watching ideas come to life on screen. 
    I’ve been hooked ever since. 😊

  <h2>Challenges & How I Overcame Them</h2>
  <p class="subtitle">Turning obstacles into opportunities through creativity, calm, and clarity.</p>

  <div class="challenge-container">
    <div class="challenge-card intro-card">
      <p>
        Working directly with marketing VPs, designers, and developers meant dealing with a lot of dynamic requests,
        often requiring out-of-the-box implementations. One recurring challenge was post-live issues due to clients
        not performing a hard refresh after deployment.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="challenge-card">
      <p>
        I remember one incident where a page went live, and soon after, there was panic. The client raised concerns
        saying "everything looks broken," with misaligned elements and visuals not rendering correctly. I stayed calm,
        assessed the situation quickly, and explained to both the team and the client that the issue was due to cached
        data and could be fixed with a hard refresh. The problem was resolved immediately, and I was appreciated for my
        timely response and clear communication.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="challenge-card">
      <p>
        Even if something was beyond what the designers could implement, I would guide them and explain,
        “You can actually do this and that.” I made sure they knew what was possible and how to approach it,
        helping turn ideas into reality even when they felt out of scope.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="challenge-card">
      <p>
        Another challenge I faced was when the development heads asked me to research a backend-related topic for the
        entire site. They said, "You can help with this." I had never worked on backend tasks before, but I didn’t say
        no. Instead, I saw it as a sign that they trusted my thinking and valued my input.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="challenge-card">
      <p>
        I spent time diving into the topic, did thorough research, and created a clear, concise report outlining the
        issue and how it could be solved. I overcame the challenge by believing in myself and the quality of my work.
        I was later appreciated for the detailed and thoughtful research I presented.
